            text: "Today Fittja Station and Square is only a point of transit, dirty and characterised by noisy traffic, the maintenance off the place is inadequate, and the lightning is damaged or broken. It lacks activities that are free/where no consumption is needed, it is both unwelcoming and an unpleasant space to stay in and places in the area feels off-limits to girls. Today it is a high risk area as people run from the tube exit to the bus stops at the other side of the road."

            text: "Fittja Station and Square could be a light and bright space with lots of colour, with good seating arrangements protected from the weather that gives all types of people a reason to stay and hang out. It should be a place that has accessible public services, that is easy to find oneâ€™s way around, has people around to help me if I need, and has youth facilities that can cater to the needs of those who may otherwise end up hanging around."

It can be a space of flexibility, multi-purpose and multi-function, providing places for women, children, and elderly to loiter."

(parts of the proposals for the square such as the activity cubes and pink street could be implemented by these actors ie moved to the current bus stop if the bus station would be moved to the other side of the square - see first proposal."

        solution: {
            title: "Main solution",
            text: "The main solution would be to make changes to the bus station. If the bus stops are moved, space is released and the noise level is lowered in the square. It is important to create a pleasant welcoming environment when you come out of the metro station as this is where your first impression of Fittja is formed. The current bus stops could be transformed into activity cubes (see proposal 1 for their function).\n\nThere is also a need to rebuild the station, both inside and in front of the entrance.Bigger openings - visually and/ or physically - both in the station building and shops.Public toilets are needed and the waiting - room can be complemented with an arcade where passengers can play and earn their SL - ticket - by for example do a physical activity, recycle cans, pick garbage or do something else valuable.The visibility in the waiting areas must be improved, lighting and better signage could make the space more safe and make it possible to use the space even when it is dark.By using modern technology and making it possible to decide the colour and lighting yourself it becomes more inclusive for everyone.\n\nFinally, an additional new entrance(from the backside) would create more flexibility when moving around and through the station, increase the flow of people, and make the backside more accessible."

            text: "First pitch the idea to citizens and then ask them what they really want, after that it is important to talk to investors and SL in order to create the changes agreed upon.\n\nRefurbish or even build a new station house that enables better overview of the locations around the station and outputs in several directions, a widened surface closest to the station for pedestrians, widened squares by complementing the bridge and removing bus lanes, and moving bus stops. Some renovation of the station hall such as upgrading of surface layers, signs and lighting. The roof outside the station hall is perceived as very dark and massive - can be removed or replaced with, for example, glass roof and greenery for ecosystem services. SL should explore the possibility to develop the idea of playing for the ticket and citizens' council can participate in developing which activities could give a ticket.\n\nWork with the design of the square and bus stops to create an integrated and vibrant public space with several functions, seating, good lighting, and at the same time maintained good accessibility in public transport. We must establish a cooperation between the municipality, the region (SL) and the mall owner.\n\nEngage in dialogue with the shop owner about turning the business more towards the station room and a dialogue with the charcoal grill owner about turning more towards the footbridge side, pulling up the roller shutters and setting up a small outdoor dining area."

There is a need for a political assignment including an allocated budget. A first step should be to pitch and summarize the idea in a more detailed manner and point out how we, as individuals can gain from these ideas. A second step would be to contact SL to explore possibilities. Contacts must also be taken with citizens for the Citizens' Council. A third step could be to apply for grants (such as government or EU subsidies), eg linked to large infrastructure investments enhancing public health, gender, sustainable cities and security in particularly vulnerable areas."
