            text: "Greenhouse 145 is the main solution because it provides a complete solution. It has a radio station so one could have podcast courses there, a cafe to mingle in and a greenhouse for gardening. We think it is important because it will become both an entertainment center, and a multicultural meeting place for young adults. It will encourage people to come and relax. It creates both life and movement in the square. It also becomes a meeting place for more people to meet and socialize on and will also challenge a particular group that only uses the place today. It is also ecologically sustainable because it is a greenhouse, and it is dressed in greenery."
